We have created an application so that workers can work efficiently and in a more orderly manner, as well as improving its design by making it more accessible to everyone. 

Frameworks we have used:
-Symfony: https://symfony.com/ (version 6.2)
-Angular: https://angular.io/ (version 15.0.1)

Along with this we have used languages such as php, html, css... to create different views depending on the type of user that uses it.

We have a login and sign-up to access the application. Once inside, depending on the type of worker you are, a different view of the application will be shown, but all of them have a main dashboard that will show different widgets with the most important information for the worker. We offer different tools such as calendar, activity view, associates or file system.
